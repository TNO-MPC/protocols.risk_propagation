"""
Plaintext version of the risk propagation algorithm.

Preprocessing should be done in the following way:

1.  Select some period "Y" over which we are going to propagate the risk scores and take all the nodes that made at least one transaction in this period. For example, 4 weeks.
2.  For all these nodes, select some period "X" over which we compute the initial risk scores. For example, the same 4 weeks as Y as well as the 4 weeks before Y. This should result in a dictionary that maps every node to an initial risk score.
3.  Define a period "Z" with which we are going to "slice" the period Y for a more fine-grained analysis. This can for example be 4 times 1 week, to lead to 4 "Z's".
4.  For each period Z, compute a (directed) transaction graph for that period by connecting nodes that send money to other nodes. As edge labels we use the amount of money transferred. If multiple transactions take place from one node to the next node, aggregate them in one edge and sum the amounts.
    Ultimately, this should be represented as a dictionary that maps each node in period Z to a dictionary with as keys the other nodes that made a transaction to this node and as value the (aggregated) amount transferred from that node. Put the dictionaries for all Z's (for example 4) into a list in the order of the Z's "dics_transactions".
5.  For each period Z, compute for each node in the transaction network from step 4 the total amount of money received by this node and put it in a dictionary mapping the node to the total amount received. Put these in a list "dics_total" that matches the order of the Z's and the order of the list resulting from step 4.
